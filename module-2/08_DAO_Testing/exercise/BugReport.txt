Test that demonstrates problem:

getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_with_valid_employee_id_returns_list_of_timesheets_for_employee()

Expected output:

getTimesheetsByEmployeeId(1) returns a list size of 2

getTimesheetsByEmployeeId(1) returns a list size of 1

How did you fix this bug?

I replaced the if in getTimesheetsByEmployeeId() with a while so it can loop.
