Hello Im Nick and for the past five years Ive had home in the banking industry as a overnight mainframe operator. During my SHIFTS, for often up to 12 hours I would preform regular maintenance and ensured our servers remained up on our NOC. Immersed in a world of computers and driven by  curiosity,  I was lead tech elevator. Where i sought to bolster my confidence with technology and take the challenge of learning software development.

I now seek to continue that journey with software through a junior developer. On a team that is presented with ever changing problems. I wish to use these problems to exercise my passion, collaborative and technical skills to make an impact and play my part in the creation of truly meaningful solutions.
